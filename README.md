# Europeana Media Player

Created as part of the DSI-4 project Europeana Media 

### First

Install deps from project root with `yarn` or `npm i`

### Start development server with:

`yarn start:dev` or `npm run start:dev`

It's possible to use a different port by specifying this first like so: 

`EUPS_PORT=7788 yarn start:dev` to start with port 7788. Same for npm just include `EUPS_PORT=7788` at the beginning.

### Build for production

`yarn build` or `npm run build`
